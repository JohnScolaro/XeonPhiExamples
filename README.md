This repository is a clone of liamb315's repository called: "XeonPhiTutorials". It contains code from the book called: "Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor High-Performance Programming". The origional repository (provided it isn't updated in the future) contains identical code to the examples from the book. This is great, and stops you from having to copy and paste them. However, this book was published in 2013, and as of the time of writing this, it's 2016. So most of the icc compiler flags have been depricated. The problems with this book that I found, is that:

1: All the compiler flags have been depricated.

2: It doesn't supply any real makefiles.

3: And it doesn't give any insight into how to set up a development environment for the Xeon Phi, or what errors ICC will throw at you.

Honestly, if I can write some more detailed README files and it saves someone a few minutes by having a look at what I've done, then this repo will have been worth it.
